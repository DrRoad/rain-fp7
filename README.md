Repository of the **Extreme Weather Risk Assessment Tool** developed within the *Risk Analysis of Infrastructure Networks in response to extreme weather* (RAIN) FP7 European project by [Grupo AIA](http://aia.es/). More information about the project at [rain-project.eu](http://rain-project.eu/).

The risk assessment tool presented allows a reproducible workflow that integrates weather threats and physical context to estimate the social impact described by specific markers, useful for decision support (in planning and operation) and the analysis of what-if scenarios.

The webtool has been developed to help owners, stakeholders, policy makers to choose the best protection option. Demonstration videos of the webtool are available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/gM6Ugu0Fjo8?list=PLPBl6rsXvRsCxbg-QMYoYsAdlrya92joZ).
