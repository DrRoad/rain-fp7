<p><strong>Webtool for Extreme Weather Risk Assessment - Energy & Telecommunications & Land Transportation</strong></p>
<p>This is the version 0.9 of the RAIN webtool developed by <a href="http://www.aia.es/en/", target ="_blank">AIA</a> in the context of the <a href="http://rain-project.eu/", target="_blank">European FP7 RAIN research project</a>.</p>
<p>This is an open, test version of the webtool available online for potential end-users, stakeholders, policy makers, researchers or anyone interested in critical infrastructure protection against extreme weather events.</p>
<p>The webtool has been developed within RAIN project to help owners, stakeholders, policy makers to choose the best protection option.</p>
<p>This risk assessment tool allows a reproducible workflow that integrates weather threats and physical context to estimate the social impact described by specific markers, useful for decision support (in planning and operation) and the analysis of what-if scenarios.</p>
<p>The tool performs a connectivity analysis of the Energy & Telecommunications and Land Transportation networks under extreme weather conditions and assess the potential impacts. </p>

<p>Current functionalities include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Visualization</strong>: It provides a view of the geographical situation of the networks and their elements. Social context information such as population of the affected area or the sectoral distribution of customers is also provided. It also shows the return time of such weather event to happen in the region and the future estimated return time for an event of the same properties. Relevant results of the meteorological and climate analysis are displayed also.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: It allows to select the extreme weather event and its features (intensity or landslide probability model); to choose the affected region; to upload new data regarding landslides in the region; to upload the properties of new engineering measures to be considered in the risk assessment analysis.</li>
	<li><strong>Risk assessment</strong>: This module calculates the failure probabilities of the various elements that compose each network and assesses the probabilities of failure of these networks. With this information assesses the economic consequences of a blackout in the case of electrical and telecommunications networks or of losing land transportation connectivity. It takes into account investment in preventive protection measures to analyse what-if scenarios and propose the best investment option. </li>
</ul>
